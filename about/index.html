We specialize exclusively on custom/bespoke jewellery. For which, 100% is designed and fabricated here in Canada <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> all raw materials, precious metals, and gemstones are sourced ethically and conflict-free. Our promise to our customers is simple: exceptional service at "<i>rock</i>" bottom prices.</p><p>From engagement rings, wedding bands, bracelets, pendants/necklaces, to earrings: we have the experience and expertise to create virtually any type of jewellery that your heart desires. Our precious gem offering is also comprehensive and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the lowest priced</span> in Canada. We offer only the finest natural &amp; laboratory-grown diamonds, emeralds, sapphires, rubies, opals, and others.</p><h4>What our Design Process is like</h4><ol><li>First, please contact us with your ideas via our <a href="info@customdiamonds.ca">email</a> or our <a href="https://customdiamonds.ca/contact/">Contact Us Form.</a> Being as descriptive as possible with your project will help us narrow down on an estimated quote as quickly as possible.</li><li class="li1"><span class="s2">We will provide you with an estimated quote, and then continue to narrow in on design, and timeliness. We will be in touch through text messaging, or we can jump on a phone or video call if preferred. If you're located in Toronto, we can also meet in person.</span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s2">At this point we know exactly what the specifics are for your project and let you know what the final price will be. </span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s2">If you are happy and would like to proceed, we'll order in any necessary stones upon receipt of a $250 non-refundable deposit.</span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s2">Once the Diamond or Gemstone arrives, either we can meet once more so that you may look at the stone yourself, or I can pass the stone directly along to my designer to begin the 3D CAD design process. To begin design &amp; manufacturing work, we ask for a deposit of 50%.</span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s2">Approximately 3 weeks later given a design of average-complexity, your Jewelry should be complete. We have the option to have your Jewelry professionally appraised as well should you desire. Remaining balance will be due upon local delivery or prior to shipping.</span></li></ol><h4><strong>Our Team</strong></h4><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);" src="https://customdiamonds.ca/media/posts/1/IMG_5431.jpeg" alt="" width="323" height="323" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://customdiamonds.ca/media/posts/1/responsive/IMG_5431-xs.jpeg 300w, https://customdiamonds.ca/media/posts/1/responsive/IMG_5431-sm.jpeg 480w, https://customdiamonds.ca/media/posts/1/responsive/IMG_5431-md.jpeg 768w, https://customdiamonds.ca/media/posts/1/responsive/IMG_5431-lg.jpeg 1024w"></figure>      Jonathan &amp; Shoshana Mostovoy<p></p><h4>How we Began (written by: Jonathan)</h4><p class="p1">Back in 2023, I had the very difficult task of purchasing an engagement ring for my soon-to-be fiancé, and later wife, Shoshana. Problem was: professionally Shoshana is an artist, so the tremendously high design standard wasn't to be trifled with. To create a unique ring incorporating numerous different design elements turned out to be incredibly difficult. The few jewellers that I visited were not interested in the large amount of work involved, and anyone who was, the price-points were unfathomable.</p><p class="p1">The solution: become our own jeweller. Over the course of a few weeks, I developed great relationships with suppliers, casters, polishers, setters, and appraisers here in Toronto, and learned how the jewellery business works.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With this knowledge plus the connections I made, there seemed to be an opportunity to provide quality, custom jewellery at a fraction of retail prices.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ring I made for Shoshana turned out to be a big success, and a few months after our wedding, Custom Diamonds Canada was born.</p><h4>But Why Are Your Prices So Low?</h4><p>Two main reasons: we charge a considerably smaller margin than everyone else, and we do not hold much inventory. The vast majority of "well-known" brick-and-mortar or online jewellery stores charge between a 500-1,500% margin on the sales of precious stones. The whole argument that classical jewellers make with respect to "this doesn't have good resale value, buy this instead" may be counter-argued by the simple fact that they're charging you 10x the fair value - of course it won't hold its value. Our goal, in comparison, is to provide incredible quality jewellery at a genuinely fair price.</p><p><br><br></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">© Copyright 2024 - All Rights Reserved by Jonathan Mostovoy &nbsp &nbsp Email: <a href="mailto:info@customdiamonds.ca">info@customdiamonds.ca</a></div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/customdiamonds.ca" class="facebook" aria-label="Facebook"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://customdiamonds.ca/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/customdiamonds.ca" class="instagram" aria-label="Instagram"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://customdiamonds.ca/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmostovoy/" class="linkedin" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://customdiamonds.ca/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@customdiamonds" class="youtube" aria-label="Youtube"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://customdiamonds.ca/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#youtube"/></svg></a></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://customdiamonds.ca/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=4268bfae06e330d473c424d50f09abda"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar'};</script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script><script src="https://customdiamonds.ca/media/plugins/pageprefetching/quicklink.umd.js"></script><script>window.addEventListener('load', () => {
